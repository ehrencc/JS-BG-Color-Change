# JS-BG-Color-Change
Simple background color changer

Struggling with my progress in coding , due to a non stable foundation. 
So I decided to start from scratch again essentially and try code without much help as possible.

The purpose of this is to just practise elementary concepts.

Open the html file and click the button to change the background color.
